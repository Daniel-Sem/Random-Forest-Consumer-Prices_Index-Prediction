# Random-Forest-Consumer-Prices-Index

This repository shows an implementation of a random forest algorithm, that is fed with public data from https://infostat.nsi.bg/infostat/pages/module.jsf?x_2=69.
The algorithm predicts the Total (Consumer Prices Index) CPI based on the available historical data for the segmented CPIs with accuracy of 99.03%.

Dropping the unimportant variables after getting their importance from the random forest feature_importances_ attribute causes an increase in the accuracy of the model to 99.22%.
